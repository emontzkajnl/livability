Create Ads with a popup and layer effect.

*Layer and PopUp*

The Layer Ads plugin is based on the free Advanced Ads plugin, a simple and powerful ad management solution for WordPress. Before using Layer Ads download, install and activate Advanced Ads for free from http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/.
You can use Advanced Ads along any other ad management plugin and don’t need to switch completely.
